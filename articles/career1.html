         <p align=left>The term multimedia refers to the use of more than one form of content together in a package. This could be the use of video and audio, text and illustrations or any combination of these. Within the high-demand industry of multimedia, there are a number of careers that combine artistry, creativity and technology.

          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Web Design</b>
          Web designers are responsible for what you see when you surf the World Wide Web. Web design is a multimedia job in which a designer creates the look, and often the content, for a client's website. Careers in this field include entrepreneurial opportunities in which designers are hired by companies to build websites. Others may choose to work for a specific company, handling all of the design and maintenance for the sites affiliated with the business.

          Web designers help plan websites, discuss content and layout and organize the items to be included on pages. This includes color schemes, audio clips, videos and advertisements. They are fluent in hypertext markup language and Javascript, languages that allow designers to create compatible content for viewing on the Internet. Designers must understand a diverse set of software programs and be skilled in graphic design to make the sites they create attractive and functional on various browsers and platforms.

          Web designers should be good communicators, not only visually but also verbally, so they can make sure the finished product is what their clients desire.

                  <b>Animation</b>
          Animation is a multimedia industry that has evolved tremendously over the past generation. The days of simple pencil drawings used to create two-dimensional figures are over. Today’s animators are multimedia and technology experts who transform creative ideas into animated sequences that many would have considered impossible just a few years ago.

Animators may work for special effects departments on film crews; they may design video games or create animated graphics for advertisers. Animators need significant training in digital graphics and computer animation to be able to compete in today’s animation field. This career requires a creative mind, the ability to draw, a firm grasp on animation technology and good collaborative skills. Many colleges now offer specialized programs for computer animation to prepare students for entry into this field.

              <p align=left>In the past, Chrome OS devices would simply treat any iPhone USB connection as a USB device, which means it is not able to use Ethernet functions.

              </p>

               <p align=left>Battery connection is more efficient due to the fact that this method provides a hardwired connection to the mobile device, this allows for a more direct power source. Hardwired connections also offer a more reliable connection.
